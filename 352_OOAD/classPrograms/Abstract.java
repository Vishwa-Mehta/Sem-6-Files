/*
 * Abstract class - has atleast one method that's abstract
 * Cannot make objects of an abs class cuz u can't access the abstract methods of class just like interfaces
 * can have both static and non-static data members
 * cannot be Final as u can't inherit it then :/
 * a class can extend only one absract class - multiple inheritance not allowed
 * faster than an interface
 * can define fields here as well as constants
 * can have constructor for abstract classes
