## Public blockchain:
- permissionless blockchains
- users are anon in the nw
- dev and add smart contracts w/o interference
- how secure?
	- transparency
	- immutable ledger
	- hashing
- trustless peering
- advantages:
	- more secure
	- more decentralised
	- self governed
	- user empowerment
- disadvantages:
	- high txn time
	- high computational power
	- less privacy
	- id unrecognised
## Private blockchain:
- permissioned
- controlled by a single org
- don't allow any user
- users id is known to all but txns are known only to those with perms
- access control mech maintained
- not fully decentralised
- for those who wanna have control over data and can provide more privacy
- ex: hyperledger fabric
- has keys for users
- features:
	- distributed
	- full replication
	- immutability
	- byzantine fault tolerant consensus
	- high perf
	- scalability
	- strong durable crypto identification
- adv
	- full privacy
	- more efficient
	- resource saving
- disadv
	- permissioned - invite only
	- not complete decentralisation
	- security concerns
	- partial data integrity
- have their own use case and applications
- use cases:
	- financial services
	- supply chain management
	- healthcare
	- real estate etc.
- companies: Walmart, Comcast, BurstIQ, etc.
- RWSet?
## Consortium Blockchain:
- aka Federated Blockchain
- permissioned 
- governed by grp of orgs
- more decentralised than Pvt n/w
- setting up consortiums are stressful
- id of participants are known
- no superior access
- ex: ripple, IBM Food trust
- hybrid b/w public and pvt
- characteristics:
	- permissioned
	- semi decentralised
	- multi party consensus
- adv
	- risk sharing
- applications:
	- finance and banking
	- suppy chain and logistics
	- insurance
	- healthcare
## Hybrid blockchain:
- blend public and pvt
- controlled access
- anon entity
- auth req
- ex: dragonchain
- pvt network:
	- data -> algorithmic transformation -> public key -> hash generated
- public network:
	- verify hash and timestamp

## Permission-less Blockchain:
- open env
- over large n/w of participants
- users need not know the identity of peers
- system is tamper proof
- for bitcoin txns are "pseudo-anonymous"
- "address" in bitcoin = "acc no" in bank
- wallet listens for txns
- actual txn is open to all
- longest chain of blocks is the accepted chain from the tree of added blocks
	- allows to share globally accepted view of the blockchain
	- needs energy to add new blocks and replace
- blocks that are not in the chain but verified are "orphan blocks"
	- remain in network just not in the main chain
## Architecture:
- application layer
- consensus layer
- storage layer
## Actors:
- architect
- user
- regulator
- developer
- operator
- membership services
- traditional processing platform
- traditional data sources
## Permissioned blockchain:
- repeated
## Hyperledger Fabric:
