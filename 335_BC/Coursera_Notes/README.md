# Week 1 - Blockchain defined
## BitCoin and Blockchain:
- Enable peer-to-peer transfer of digital assets without **intermediaries** in a **decentralised** network.
- Originally created to support BitCoin
- Trust between unknown peers
- Recording txn in an immutable ledger
- Establishing trust through:
	- Validation
	- Verification
	- Consensus
	- Immutable recording
### Intro of bitcoin:
- contributions:
	- digital currency system
	- autonomous decentralised application
- Satoshi Nakamoto: new currency - BitCoin
- p2p transfer of value without any central authority
- Security and trust?
	- software programs for validation, verification, consensus in an infrastucture called **blockchain**.

## Blockchain Structure:
### Basic Structure of a blockchian:
- Transaction: basic element of bitcoin blockchain
- they're validated and broadcast
- many transactions -> form a block
- many blocks -> chain through a digital data link
- blocks need to be **verified** so they go through a **consensus** process to select next block that's to be added to the chian
- this **validation and consensus** are carried out by special peer nodes called "**miners**".
- miners: **powerful** computers executing the **software** that's defined by the "blockchain protocol".
### Single Transaction:
- Fundamental concept -> **Unspent Transaction Output** -> **UTXO**
- all UTXOs collectively **define the state** of the bitcoin blockchain
- referenced as "**inputs**" in a transaction, they're also "**outputs**" of a txn.
- stored by the participant nodes in the blockchain
- txn uses the "amount" specified in UTXOs and "transmits" it to newly created **output** UTXOs.
- UTXO contains:
	- **Unique identifier** of transaction that **created** the UTXO
	- **index/position** of the UTXO in the **txn output** list
	- **value/amount**
	- **conditions under which it can be spent** -> optional
- Txn contains:
	- **reference number** of "current txn"
	- refernce to >= 1 input **input UTXOs**
	- refernce to >= 1 input **output UTXOs** generated by the txn
	- total **input and output** amoutn
- Transaction Number

- amount in 3 input UTXOs is used to generate 2 new output UTXOs
- the numbers are the references to the UTXOs

- header and info
- set of valid txns
- genesis block -> introduced for future blocks -> block number zero
- this was created by Satoshi Nakamoto - one txn of 50 BTC

- txns -> transfer of value in the bitcoin blockchain
- UTXO -> defines inputs and outputs of a txn
- once block verified -> agreed by miners algorithmically -> added to chain of blocks -> **blockhain**
## Basic Operations:
- Resposibility of peers and their computational nodes (ie their systems - laptops, desktops, server racks, etc.)
- Operations include:
	1. **Validation** of txns
	2. **Gathering** txns for a block
	3. **Broadcasting** these valid txns in a block
	4. **Consensus** on next block creation
	5. **Chaining blocks** to form an immutable record
- Participant roles:
	- those who **initiate transfer of value** ie create txn
	- **Miners** who also 
		- verify txn -> carried out independently by all miners
		- broadcast txns
		- compete to **claim right to the block**
		- work on **reaching consensus** by vlaidating block
		- **broadcast newly created block**
		- confirm txns
- miners get paid in BitCoin for these efforts
- process of validation includes many criteria (>20) like size, syntax, etc.
	- Referenced input adn output UTXOs are valid and correct
	- Input and output amounts are matched
- set of txns are selcted from the pool of valid txns to create a block
- If EVERY miner adds a block to the chain then we have a problem as it leads to multiple branches of the chain creating an inconsistency :/. How to overcome this?
- Miners compete by **solving a "computational" and CPU intensive puzzle** to determine who owns the right to the block
- that solved block is **broadcast** -> participants reach consensus -> block added to chain and confirmed
- block is also added to every local copy of the blockchain

- algorithm for consensus : **Proof of Work** protocol
- Index 0 of Transaction 0 is created by the miner of the block -> has a special UTXO and no **input** UTXO -> **Coinbase transaction** that generates -> **Miners fee** (currently 12.5BTC) -> new coint minted in bitcoin
## Beyond Bitcoin:
- Bitcoin source code is open source and source code was extended to release diff cryptocurrencies
- 300+ cruptocurrencies were introduced
- BitCoin has a special feature -> **Scripts** -> for **conditional transfer** of values
- **Ethereum** -> extended the feature to an execution framework -> **Smart Contracts**
- Smart contracts provide -> ability of **code execution** -> embeds **business logic** on the blockchain
- Based on this we have 3 types of blockchain:
	1. Only coins in cryptocurrency. Ex: BitCoin
	2. Cryptocurrency + Business logic layer. Ex: Ethereum
	3.  Only Business Logic, No currency. Ex: Linux Foundation Hyperledger
- Blockchain Categories (Based on Access Limits):
	- Public
		- Ex: BitCoin
		- Wallet applications -> interface to transfer value through the chain
	- Private
		- Access to blockchain limited to selected participants
		- Helps simplify operations : block creation and contingence model
		- controlled access to blockchain
	- Permissioned/Consortium
		- meant for a grp of collaborating parties to transact on a blockchain to ease governance, provenance and accountability
		- Ex: consortium of automobile companies
		- Benefits of Public blockchain and allowing only users with permissions to transact and operate
		- controlled access to blockchain
# Week 2 - Ethereum Blockchain 
## Smart Contracts:
- framework for execution of code was introduced by ethereum founders
- enables transactions that carry out more sophisticated operations
- like a class definition in an object oriented design
- has data, functions, access specifiers, getter and setters
- many languages to write smart contracats - ex Solidity
![Pasted image 20230126191138.pn](./7.png)
- Parts of the code:
	- **pragma**: specifies version of solidity used
	- **contract**:  specifies the start of the contract
	- **uint**: data type unsigned int
	- **function**: for write and read of data 
- Exceution of code? -> computational infra? -> every node should be able to execute the code irrespective of the the underlying stuff like OS, H/W, etc. 
- Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM): run anywhere abstraction
- High level prog lang -> EVM Byte Code -> deployed on the EVM
- smart contracts allow execution of code -> enhancing basic value transfer capability of blockchain

## Ethereum Structure:
- Ethereum introduced "accounts" in the txn -> originator and the target of a txn
- directly updates the acc balances instead of maintaining a "state" like in UTXOs
- transmit of values n messages n data that may result in state transitions -> implemented using txns
- accs are basic units of the ethereum protocol
- 2 types of accounts:
	- externally owned (EOA)
		- controlled by pvt keys
		- needed to participate in the network
		- interacts w/ chain using txns
	- contract (CA)
		- can be activated only by an EOA
		- represents a smart contract
		- every acc has coin balance
		- participant can send txn to send ether or invoke a smart contract
		- payed in **Wei**, 1 Ether = 10<sup>18</sup> Wei 
- txn ethereum has:
	- recepient of message
	- DS of the sender for authorisation
	- amt of wei to tranfer
	- optional payload with message to a contract
	- startgas - value repres the max no of computational steps for the txn
	- gasprice - sender fee for the computation
- ethereum block structure has:
	- header
	- txns
	- runner-up blk headers 
## Ethereum Operations:
- for a transfer - amt + trget addr + fees/gas points
- the fees are transfered to the accs
![Pasted image 20230126211114.png](./8.png)
- eth node - computational sys representing the bussiness entity or the individual participant
- eth full node - hosts s/w for txn init, validation, etc...
- smart contract - designed, developed compiled, deployed on the EVM 
- more than one SC in and EVM
- execution code corresponding to the SC is activated and executed on the EVM - input extracted from the payload of the txn
- curr state of SC - values of the vars defined in it - state updated by this exec - result of exec stored in a receipt - blockchain maintains the state hash and the receipt hash
- all txns generated are validated
	- TS and Nonce combination is valid
	- sufficient fees are available for exec
- invoked SC code is executed by all miners
- validated txns are braodcast and gathered for block creation
- consensus protocol used - Memory based not CPU based PoW
## Incentive Model:
- gas related items in a txn:
	- every action requires crypto fuel/gas
	- gas points are used to specify the for ease of computation
	- gas points allow - independent valuation of txn fee and computation fee
	- ether varies as market prices change, gas points don't
- gas related items in a block:
	- gas limit - amt of gas points available 
	- gas spent - actual amt of gas spent at the completion of each block
- mining incentive model:
	- miner incentivised with the base fees of 3 eths + txn fee in blockchain + fees for execution of contract txns
	- miners who solve the puzzle but don't win - ommers - blocks created are called "ommer blocks" added as "side blocks" to the main chain
	- ommer miners also get a small % of total gas points as consolation and for n/w sec
- any transaction requires fees (transfer of ether included) to be specified in the txn
